Using the program is very simple. When the program is started you will be shown what actions you can take.
This is a general theme throughout the program. As such it should be very easy to find what you're looking
for.

Every action is done on a selected object. So for example, if you wanted to remove an activity from a
project, you would have to log in as the developer you want to perform the action, view the developer's
activities, select the activity you want to remove and then at last select the "Remove this activity"
action. 

You will never be shown an action that you are not allowed to perform, so you don't have to worry about
such.
